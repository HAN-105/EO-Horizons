Mod Version: v1.0.3
Stellaris Version: v1.4.*

This is a lightweight version of EvE Online: Horizon. It contains all the graphical features and some content features of the main mod. The main purpose is to have a mod, which is easy to update and maintain, while bringing some of the EvE Online flavour that the main mod brings. 

I will try to update this mod after patches as fast as possible and upload the new version. 

[h1]Features[/h1]
	- 18 pre-scripted factions from EvE Online with system initializers, flags & traits. (All the factions are set to not spawn. If you want them to spawn, you need to enable them.)
	- 4 species classes: Amarr, Gallente, Caldari, Minmatar with each 10 ship models, 12 portraits (6 male/6 female), name list and species names.
	- 35 flag emblems.
	- Empire Space map with named systems and randomized hyperplanes.

[h1]Roadmap[/h1]
	- Update localisations for trait event.
	- Add unique icons for all traits.
	- Add more factions (Caldari Megacorps, Quafe Company, Amarr Holder Families, Serpentis, Jove Directorate)
	- Add custom start screen messages for all factions.
	- Add more sections for battlecruiser and capital ships.
	- Add customized behaviours for new ship classes (Currently battlecruiser behaves like a cruiser and capital ships behave like a battleship).

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

This mod is compatible with all mods, as it does not alter any files.

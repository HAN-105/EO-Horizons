Mod: 		v1.0.1_beta
Stellaris: 	v1.4.0

This mod is in beta and will have some bugs, missing localisation & icons and many balance issues. Please report them.

The goal of this mod is to eventually create the full EvE Online experience.
However it is currenlty in heavy (and slow) development and most updates will likely break your save games.

In order to improve this mod we will require a lot of feedback from players.

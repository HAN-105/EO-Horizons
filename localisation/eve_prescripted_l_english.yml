 #### Empire Names & Descriptions
 #Amarr Factions
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_amarr:0 "Amarr Empire"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_amarr_desc:0 "The Amarr Empire has endured the dark ages and united Amarr Prime under their benevolent rule. Amarr society is led by their unwavering faith and their economy is fuelled by slave labour. Their faith is what pushes them forward to conquer and subjugate all of New Eden in the name of God."
 START_SCREEN_AMARR_EMPIRE:0 "Several thousand years ago our ancestors settled on the continent §YAmarr§!. The peoples were divided into several small city-states, led by petty warlords. This continued for about 8000 years, when §YAmash-Akura§!, the warlord of the city-state §YDom-Torsad§!, reinvigorated our faith and conquered the entire continent in a mere 20 years. He was named Emperor by the unified Church and founded the §YCouncil of Apostles§! with the most loyal Holder families.\n\nThen in 20022 the §YUdorians§! arrived on our shores. The Emperor of the time reminded our people of their duty to spread the True Faith and so the §YFirst Great Reclaiming§! was launched. As the §YUdorians§! refused to simply submit to our rule they were enslaved or killed. During this time we encountered the §YKhanid§! as well, who embraced the §YTrue Faith§! and became loyal subjects. Now we have united the World and have found a way to travel to the stars!"

 # Gallente Factions
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_gallente:0 "Gallente Federation"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_gallente_desc:0 "Few societies display such stark contrasts. Many of the wealthiest people in the world are Gallenteans, creating a constant demand for luxury goods. At the same time, the ranks of the poor number millions, because while the liberal market-driven economy and individual freedom may allow everybody the chance to advance to the top, they make it just as easy to plummet to the very bottom of the social ladder. \n\nIn the world of EVE, the Gallentean are the kings of entertainment, mass-producing everything from cheap porn-flicks to elaborate stage-shows for an ever-hungry public. They boast the most elaborate luxury space yachts, and the most glittering hotel reservoirs. Anything your mind or body could ever crave, the Gallenteans have plenty of it.\n\nThe Gallenteans are not alone in their Federation, whose boundaries are home to pockets of residents, varying in size and representing all the other races of EVE, most of whom left their own empires due to political or ideological differences, or simply in search of peace and prosperity. In addition to these there are two human races, the Intakis and the Mannars, both of whom the Gallenteans found while exploring and expanding their empire. Both were at a very primitive level when the Gallenteans found them, but since coming under the protection and guidance of the Gallenteans, both races have flourished and are today a full-fledged members of the Federation.\n\nThe Caldari were initially part of the Federation but deep-seated differences and mutual animosity between them and the Gallenteans drove them out to found their own empire. For a time, the two empires warred against each other, but as neither could gain sufficient advantage to claim victory, peace was settled in the end."

 # Minmatar Factions
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_minmatar:0 "Minmatar Republic"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_minmatar_desc:0 "A tough, no-nonsense race, the Minmatar are a determined and independent people. Their home planet of Matar is a natural paradise, although centuries of abuse have taken much from its beauty.\n\nFor the Minmatar, the most important thing in life is to be able to take care of yourself on your own, and although kin and family play an important role in their society, they prefer identifying themselves by the clan or tribe to which they belong. A clan can have any number of people in it, and its size is largely dictated by the main activity of its members. Most specialize in one area of activity. While those who live on a planet can focus on agricultural or industrial activity, others who travel around the world of EVE concentrate on trading, pirating, and suchlike. In the distant past the clans constantly warred against each other. Since then, however, Minmatar have learned that cooperation is more important, and although the clans still try to maintain their regional and ideological identities, they act as a single unit towards other races.\n\nThe fortunes of the Minmatar have ebbed and flowed continuously. At one time they had a flourishing empire with a level of mechanical excellence never before or since seen anywhere. Later, however, they had to endure centuries of enslavement, toiling and dying for the benefit of foreign masters. Today most of them have regained their freedom, but the legacy of their enslavement has been the diaspora of the race.\n\nThe Minmatar are the most numerous of all the races in the world of EVE, but their vast numbers are divided into many factions. While the Minmatar Republic is the official state, only a quarter of all Minmatar are part of it. The largest proportion, almost a third, are enslaved within the huge Amarr Empire, while a fifth resides within the Gallente Federation, creating a powerful political bloc which keeps relations between the Gallenteans and the Amarrians in a constant state of tension. The remainder, who are not part of any formal organization, live as freemen throughout the world. Many are itinerant labourers, roaming from one system to another in search for work. A fair number make their living on the darker side of the law, acting as pirates, smugglers and peddlers in all kinds of illegal goods, and many of the larger criminal groups in the world of EVE are run by Minmatar."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_thukker_tribe:0 "Thukker Tribe"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_thukker_tribe_desc:0 "The Thukker Tribe roams the Great Wildlands. They have left the other Minmatar tribes behined after encountering the Amarr Slavers for the first time. Since then they have been without a home."

 # Caldari Factions
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_caldari:0 "Caldari State"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_caldari_desc:0 "A state built on corporate capitalism, the Caldari State is run by a few mega-corporations which divide the state between them, controlling and ruling every aspect of society. Each corporation is made up of thousands of smaller companies, ranging from industrial companies to law firms. All land and real estate is owned by a company which leases it to the citizens, and government and policing are also handled by independent companies. \n\nWhile the Caldari State may not be nearly as big as that of the Gallenteans, let alone the Amarrians, they are still universally feared and admired. Their economy is strong, and their military might parallel to that of the larger empires. Coupled to the fact that they are more unscrupulous than the Gallenteans and more combative than the Amarrians, this makes them in many ways the most meddlesome of all the empires. As most Caldari trade is conducted by individual companies rather than the State itself, this makes it difficult for the other empires to deal with them at a political level. If a company is found guilty of unethical business dealings, it simply disappears into its parent corporation, and before long another one appears to take its place. But if a Caldari company is threatened, the whole corporation and often the whole State backs it up with full force. \n\nIt was at this time that the corporations established themselves as the driving force behind creating and maintaining the new Caldari State. Even if the Caldari have not engaged in war for many decades, they still strive to be at the cutting edge of military technology and their vessels, weapons and fighting methods are inferior to none but the enigmatic Jovians. \n\nTo curb their aggressive tendencies, the Caldari actively pursue and sponsor a range of sporting activities. Many of these are bloody, gladiatorial-like competitions, while others are more like races. But whatever the sport, the Caldari love betting on the outcome, making gambling a massive industry in the State. \n\nThe Caldari State offers its citizens the best and the worst in living conditions. As long as you keep in line, do your job, uphold the laws and so forth, life can be fairly pleasant and productive. But for those who are not cut out for this strict, disciplined regime life quickly becomes intolerable. They lose their respect, family, status, everything, and the only options left to them are suicide or exile. Although not xenophobic as such, the Caldari are very protective of their way of life and tolerate only those foreigners that stick to the rules."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ishukone_corporation:0 "Isukone Corporation"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ishukone_corporation_desc:0 "Ishukone was for a long time the feeblest of the Caldari mega corporations, but contact with the Jovians changed that. Ishukone was the first company to establish trade links with the Jovians and received the capsule technology from the Jovians, which made Ishukone billions of ISK in revenue before other companies could catch up. Ishukone is still reaping the rewards of their good relations with the Jovians and it possesses the most advanced technology outside Jove space."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_cbd_corporation:0 "CBD Corporation"
